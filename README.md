# Blinkit Grocery Sales Dashboard (Excel)



​This repository contains the Blinkit Grocery Sales Dashboard, a comprehensive data visualization project created entirely in Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provides a dynamic overview of sales, customer ratings, and key operational metrics for a fictional grocery outlet.

​Project Overview
​The Blinkit Grocery Sales Dashboard leverages Excel's powerful data and visualization tools to transform raw grocery sales data into actionable insights. It is designed for operational managers and business analysts to quickly monitor performance, identify trends, and filter data based on key criteria. The dashboard's core goal is to provide a clear, single-page view of the business health.

​Key Features
​The dashboard includes a variety of interactive elements and visualizations to facilitate in-depth analysis:
​Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): At the top, a clear display of vital metrics:
​Total Sales: The cumulative sales amount.
​Avg Sales: The average sales per transaction or period.
​Net of Items: The total number of items sold.
​Avg Rating: The average customer rating, providing a measure of satisfaction.
​Interactive Filter Panel: The dashboard features a user-friendly filter panel on the left side, allowing users to slice the data by:
​Outlet Size: High, Medium, or Small.
​Outlet Location: Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 cities.
​Item Type: Categories like "Fruits and Vegetables," "Household," "Meat," "Snack Foods," etc.
​Data Visualizations: The dashboard includes several charts to visually represent the data:
​Outlet Establishment Trend: A time-series chart showing sales trends over several years.
​Fat Content & Item Type Breakdown: Donut and bar charts that illustrate the distribution of items by their fat content and type.
​Outlet Size & Location Breakdown: Pie and bar charts that show sales distribution across different outlet sizes and locations.
​Underlying Data: The project includes the raw data, meticulously organized in separate sheets, which feed directly into the dashboard. This structure demonstrates a complete data workflow from raw data to final visualization.

​PivotTables and PivotCharts: To summarize and visualize the data.
